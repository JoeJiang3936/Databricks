io 


partition resources in the cloud ? 





- approach
- ratio 
- elastic 
- ratio:  compute/network/io ratio static
- workload
- cloud perf vs on-premises
- compare:  cloud vs on-premise ? 




The parquet design goals are interoperability, space efficiency, and query efficiency ! 
Reuse.
Language agnostic 
well defined at the binary format. 
no double conversion
file format and back 
data model:  avro 
framework:  spark
query engine:  hive, impala
store column by column, all same type, all homgeous
homogeneous thing, compression easier 
READ only the data you need ! 
skip all the data you need (go straight to the column)
projection 
statistics 
parquet has statistics 
dont scan the entire file ! ! ! 
compression comparisons:  tpch:  compression 
decoding time vs compresssion:  R ggplot2 graph

Having your full genome sequenced means:
- 130X Coverage for the Whole Exome
- 30X Coverage for the non-coding regions of the DNA
- Expanded with analysis of your Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
- Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)

Whole Genome Sequencing
